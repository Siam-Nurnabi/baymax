# Patient Management System 

Individual doctor will have information whenever a patient come again. Patient do not have to bring previous history record. Rather all of the previous record will be stored.

The Web-based Patient Management System will attempt to automate and replace the traditional paper based approach for patient management and tracking . The paper based approach is quite tedious and it results in a lot of time wastage.
