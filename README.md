# Patient Management System 

Doctor will store patient specific information.So whenever a patient come again,patient won't have to bring previous history record. Rather all of previous record will be available to the doctor.

The Web-based Patient Management System will attempt to automate and replace the traditional paper based approach for patient management and tracking . The paper based approach is quite tedious and it results in a lot of time wastage.
